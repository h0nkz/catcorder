Stuff I had to do to make it work:
- Run sudo upgrade libcamera
- Add dtoverlay=ov5647 and camera_auto_detect=0 to /boot/firmware/config.txt (this made rasp desktop stop working??
- uninstall realvnc-vnc-server to be able to upgrade system
- reinstall realvnc-vnc-server to be able to use rasp desktop
